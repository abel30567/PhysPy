    "    Quantum mechanical processes are fundamentally random processes. For example one cannot predict at what time exactly an atom in an excited state performs a transition from an excited state to its ground state. What can be calculated is the probability for this process to occur within a certain time interval. Since the lifetimes of excited states in an atom are often very short it is difficult to directly observe the random nature of these processes. However certain nuclear processes occur with such small probabilities that the associated lifetimes are long and their random nature is relatively easy to observe. \n",
